**React Electron Template** is help you to build multi-platform desktop apps easier. **Don't worry about the configuration 🔨** this template will take care of that, focus on your codes⌨️ <!-- million dollar projects --> and project ideas 💡. The idea is to solve the common issues with connecting those frameworks, build a robust Template to support daily development needs, and help developers use better practices while working with popular JavaScript components.

## 📚 Before You Begin

Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a **React Electron Template**:

- **Node.js** - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.

- **Electron.js** - The best way to understand Electron is through its [Official Website](https://www.electronjs.org/), which has a [Getting Started](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest) guide, You can also go through this [TutorialsPoint Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/electron/index.htm) for more resources.

- **React.js** - React's [Official Website](https://reactjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [W3Schools Popular Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/REACT/DEFAULT.ASP), and [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).

- **TypeScript** - Go through [TypeScript Official Website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/), which should help you understand TypeScript better.

## 🖥️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- **Git** - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
- **Node.js** - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.

NOTE: This project requires NodeJS (version 14 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.

## 🛫 Quick Start

There are several ways you can get the React Electron Template:

### 🌀 Cloning The GitHub Repository

The recommended way to get React Electron Template is to use git to directly clone the repository:

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/react-electron-template.git <your-project-name>

# Enter the project directory
cd <your-project-name>
```

This will clone the latest version of the React Electron Template repository to a **react-electron-template** folder.

### 🗃️ Downloading The Repository Zip File

Another way to use the React Electron Template is to download a zip copy from the [main branch on GitHub](https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/react-electron-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). You can also do this using the `wget` command:

```sh
wget https://github.com/AjayKanniyappan/react-electron-template/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -O react-electron-template-main.zip; unzip react-electron-template-main.zip; rm react-electron-template-main.zip
```

Don't forget to rename react-electron-template-main after your project name.

### 🧰 Quick Install

Once you've downloaded the Template and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your Electron, React application.

The Template comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` file that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
# Install dependency
npm install
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```bash
# Install dependency
yarn add
```

This command does a few things:

- First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
- If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.

## 👨‍💻 Starting Development

Use your favorite JavaScript Package Managers **npm** or **yarn** or **pnpm**

### 🏃 Running Your Application

**Run your application using npm:**

```sh
npm start
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn:

```sh
yarn start
```

Your **React** application should run on port http://localhost:5050 on top of **Electron** with the development environment configuration.

Explore **configs/webpack.renderer.dev.ts** for development environment configuration options.

### 🛬 Change Port Number

If the localhost 5050 port number already in use! or if you like to change your **React application number.**

Go to 👉 DevConfig.json and change the port number 5050 to **your-port-number**
